          My group and I worked together on this Jamboard to get ideas on what we are looking for in this application. We used ideas concerning Design, basic features of our app, organization, User Abilities, and the back end of our app. We wanted to create a streamlined thought process about what would be going into this application and have so far succeded in our goals.
